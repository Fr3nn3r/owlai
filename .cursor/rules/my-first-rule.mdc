# Code Change Process
1. First analyze the problem and explain the root cause
2. Propose a simple solution with minimal changes
3. Wait for explicit confirmation before making any changes
4. Avoid complex refactoring unless specifically requested
5. Keep solutions focused on the immediate problem
6. If multiple solutions exist, explain the trade-offs

# Code Change Guidelines
- Maximum 10 lines of code changes per edit unless explicitly approved
- No new dependencies without clear benefit explanation
- No refactoring without explicit confirmation
- Focus on fixing the immediate issue rather than improving the codebase
